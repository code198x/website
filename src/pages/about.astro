      <h1>About This Project</h1>
    </header>

    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>Code Like It's 198x is a long-term personal project to learn how to write code—especially games—for the home computers and consoles of the 1980s and early 90s. Starting with the ZX Spectrum, I'm working my way through a range of machines like the Commodore 64, BBC Micro, Amiga, Atari ST, MSX, Apple II, and NES.</p>
    <p>It's not just about nostalgia. It's about understanding how these machines really worked: how they drew graphics, produced sound, handled input, managed memory, and got around hard limitations with clever hacks. It's part learning journey, part creative outlet, and part attempt to finally finish what I started as a kid.</p>
    <p>All code, tools, and learnings will be shared openly as I go.</p>

    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>When I was about four years old, I watched my stepdad code a Hangman game on his C64. I didn't know what he was doing, but I knew it mattered. A few years later I got my own ZX Spectrum, and spent hours typing in magazine listings, tweaking code, and dreaming of making my own games.</p>
    <p>I never finished any. Life got in the way.</p>
    <p>I missed the original bedroom coder boom by a few years, but the dream stuck. I kept coding—Amiga, PC, modern languages, real software—but I never went back to really understand those old machines. I never closed that loop.</p>
    <p>This is me doing exactly that.</p>

    <h2>What you'll find here</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Posts about specific systems: architecture, quirks, developer culture</li>
      <li>Walkthroughs of making things work on real or emulated hardware</li>
      <li>Tools, tips, and Docker-based workflows to help others follow along</li>
      <li>Reflections on programming, childhood, creativity, and memory</li>
      <li>Actual games (eventually), written for machines with less RAM than a JPEG</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Who this is for</h2>
    <p>This project is for anyone who ever felt the spark.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Maybe you had a ZX Spectrum, a C64, or a BBC Micro—and you typed in listings from magazines, not knowing what half of it meant, but somehow knowing it mattered.</li>
      <li>Maybe you grew up just after that era, watching it fade away, and always wondered what it would've been like to be part of it.</li>
      <li>Maybe you wrote disk mags or unfinished games at school, then grew up and moved on, and now feel the itch to go back—not just to remember, but to understand.</li>
      <li>Maybe you work in modern software, but want to know what came before—not just historically, but viscerally. What it felt like to write for machines that had hard limits, weird architectures, and no safety nets.</li>
      <li>Or maybe you're just curious. About the machines. About the people. About what it meant to create something from almost nothing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If so, you're welcome here.</p>

    <h2>If you want to follow along</h2>
    <p>This project is personal, but it's not private.</p>
    <p>I'll be documenting everything I learn: the code, the tools, the weird emulator configs, the bugs I hit and the ones I caused. I'm using modern tools like Docker to create reproducible environments—so if you want to try coding for these machines yourself, you won't have to dig through 40-year-old forums just to get started.</p>
    <p>Whether you're just curious, thinking of dusting off an old project, or want to dive in and try writing your own game from scratch—feel free to use what I build. Steal my Makefiles. Fork my repos. Break things.</p>
    <p>There's no signup, no newsletter, no funnel.</p>
    <p>Just the joy of figuring it out together.</p>
