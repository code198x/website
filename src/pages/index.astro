			<h1>Welcome to Code Like It's 198x</h1>
		</header>
		<p>I grew up dreaming of making games. I had a ZX Spectrum, a head full of ideas, and a stack of magazine listings I barely understood. I never quite finished anything—but I never stopped wondering what might have been.</p>
		<p>This site is my way of going back. I'm learning to write code for the machines I grew up with—and all the ones I missed. The Spectrum, the C64, the BBC Micro, the Amiga, and more. I want to understand how they worked, what made them different, and how developers created magic with just a few kilobytes of memory.</p>
		<p>This isn't nostalgia. It's unfinished business. You're welcome to follow along.</p>
