<Layout title="Welcome to Code Like It's 198x">
  <p>
    I grew up dreaming of making games. I had a ZX Spectrum, a head full of
    ideas, and a stack of magazine listings I barely understood. I never quite
    finished anything—but I never stopped wondering what might have been.
  </p>
  <p>
    This site is my way of going back. I'm learning to write code for the
    machines I grew up with—and all the ones I missed. The Spectrum, the C64,
    the BBC Micro, the Amiga, and more. I want to understand how they worked,
    what made them different, and how developers created magic with just a few
    kilobytes of memory.
  </p>
  <p>
    This isn't nostalgia. It's unfinished business. You're welcome to follow
    along.
