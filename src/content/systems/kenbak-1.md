The **Kenbak-1** is widely regarded as the first personal computer, released in 1971â€”years before the microprocessor became commercially available. Designed by John Blankenbaker, it used small- and medium-scale TTL (transistor-transistor logic) chips instead of a CPU, making it a purely logic-based machine.

It featured 256 bytes of memory and was programmed using a series of front-panel switches and LEDs. Despite its historical significance, fewer than 50 units were ever built, and it was a commercial failureâ€”largely due to being too far ahead of its time.

- The Kenbak-1 was declared the "first personal computer" by the Computer History Museum.
- Its creator, John Blankenbaker, sold it for $750 in 1971 (roughly $5,500 today).
- Programming it involved entering binary code manually via switchesâ€”no keyboard, no monitor.
