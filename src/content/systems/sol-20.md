The **SOL-20** was one of the first computers to come in a complete, usable form with built-in keyboard and video output, released in 1976 by Processor Technology. It was designed by Lee Felsenstein, a key figure in the Homebrew Computer Club and a pioneer of open computing design.

Unlike many contemporaries that relied on external terminals or toggle switches, the SOL-20 came with a full-travel keyboard, integrated video display support, and ran software from cassette storage. It was a breakthrough in usability and aesthetics for the personal computer market.
