summary: Your very first ZX Spectrum BASIC program.

Welcome to your first lesson! We're going to write a simple program in Sinclair BASIC that prints a message to the screen.

```basic
10 PRINT "HELLO, WORLD!"
20 GO TO 10
```

Type this into your emulator and run it. You'll see a cascade of greetings endlessly filling the screen!

Press Break or reset the emulator to stop the program.
