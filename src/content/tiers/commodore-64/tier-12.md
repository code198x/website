Work smarter, not slower.

You’ll:
- Use external assemblers and Makefiles to streamline development
- Build tile/sprite/music tools in modern scripting languages
- Write scripts to convert image/sound data into C64 formats
- Automate testing and emulator launching

This tier bridges 198x and modern dev practice. It’s retro dev with a real pipeline.
