Welcome to the real C64 memory model.

You’ll:
- Understand memory banking and address decoding
- Use `$01` to switch out BASIC, KERNAL, and I/O ROM
- Safely copy routines into hidden RAM and back again
- Read and write to colour RAM, screen RAM, and character memory

The C64’s 64K is more like a puzzle than a pool — and this is how you solve it.
