Welcome to the demo coder’s playground.

You’ll:
- Use raster interrupts to change colours mid-frame
- Mix bitmap and character graphics on screen
- Animate the border and create timed effects
- Create basic plasma/rainbow or sprite split visuals

Everything the VIC-II lets you do — and a few things it doesn’t — lives here.
