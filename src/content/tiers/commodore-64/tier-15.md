This is your production-ready framework.

You’ll:
- Build title screens and state machines
- Create level loading and in-memory overlays
- Add game over, lives, score tracking, and audio cues
- Design game loop structure that’s readable and extendable

If Tier 12 made you a dev, Tier 15 makes you a publisher.
