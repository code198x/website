It’s time to make the SID sing.

You’ll:
- Learn the SID register layout and control schemes
- Generate square, triangle, sawtooth and noise waveforms
- Control pitch, volume, envelope, and filter settings
- Compose simple tunes using patterns or lookup tables

The SID chip was ahead of its time. You’re now a 3-channel composer, with a 1MHz orchestra at your command.
