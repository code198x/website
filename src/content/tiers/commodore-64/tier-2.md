description: "BASIC 2.0 can’t even multiply two strings — so we’re going deeper. In this tier, you’ll write your first 6502 routines, launch them with SYS, and realise how much faster things can be."

This tier bridges the gap between BASIC and machine code.

You’ll:
- Learn 6502 architecture, registers, and addressing modes
- Use the `SYS` command to jump into memory-resident machine code
- Write your first routines to manipulate memory and draw patterns
- Install and use a monitor (like the built-in one in VICE or C64Studio)

Once you’ve tasted speed, there’s no going back. You’re about to become a 6502 native speaker.
