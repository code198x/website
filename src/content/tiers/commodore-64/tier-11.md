Shrink your assets and load them fast.

You’ll:
- Implement basic RLE and byte-pair compression routines
- Store and restore compressed sprites and tiles
- Create a custom load-and-decompress routine in 6502
- Explore TurboTape-style fastload concepts

Optimising for memory and load time is how commercial devs squeezed fun into 1980s hardware.
