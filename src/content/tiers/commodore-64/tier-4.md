In this tier, you’ll get your hands on the VIC-II.

You’ll:
- Understand screen RAM and colour RAM layout
- Print characters to screen with assembly
- Modify the character set for custom fonts and UDGs
- Switch into bitmap mode and begin drawing raw pixels

This is where C64 graphics begin. It’s messy, low-level, and beautiful.
