This is the final tier. You’re doing things the manual warned you about.

You’ll:
- Write self-modifying code to squeeze routines into tight cycles
- Chain raster effects and IRQ multiplexing
- Use undocumented opcodes or stable illegal instructions
- Build a full program ready for cartridge or cracktro release

It’s not just code now — it’s artistry, performance, and precision.
