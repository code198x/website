Clean code wins.

You’ll:
- Separate routines into modular source files
- Use assembler macros, labels, and constants effectively
- Build utility libraries for graphics, input, and sound
- Maintain clean zero-page usage and memory maps

This tier prepares you for real projects — not one-offs. You’re now coding like a team of 1980s professionals… without the cigarettes.
