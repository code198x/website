Welcome to Tier 1 for the Commodore 64.

You’ll:
- Load and run programs from tape or disk using `LOAD` and `RUN`
- Explore the built-in BASIC 2.0 environment and what it *can’t* do
- Type in listings from magazines and experiment with short edits
- Learn the quirks of C64 screen codes, character sets, and the function keys

The goal here isn’t to make art — it’s to get comfy with your keyboard, the screen, and the idea that the border might flash for no good reason. Onward!
