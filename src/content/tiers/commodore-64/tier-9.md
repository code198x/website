Raster timing makes demos beautiful and games feel smooth.

You’ll:
- Learn to hook raster interrupts via `$D012` and `$0314`
- Use vertical and horizontal scrolling registers
- Achieve full-screen smooth scrolling
- Split the screen to show different graphics modes at once

These techniques are at the heart of nearly every polished C64 game. And now they’re yours.
