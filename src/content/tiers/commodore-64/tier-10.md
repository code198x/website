This tier gives your sprites life.

You’ll:
- Build frame-based animation systems
- Manage animation timing and frame switching
- Handle sprite-to-sprite and sprite-to-background collisions
- Write a simple player input system and movement engine

Sprite logic is game logic. Master this, and you’re making real games.
