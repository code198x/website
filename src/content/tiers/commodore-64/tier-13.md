Tier 13 makes you the first thing the player sees.

Youâ€™ll:
- Create custom BASIC stubs that run your game logic
- Write machine code loaders for tape or disk
- Add visual/audio intros with delay timing
- Patch system vectors to override RESET and IRQ behaviour

The loader is part of the art. And now you own the whole boot sequence.
