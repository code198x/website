Sprites are where C64 games come to life.

You’ll:
- Enable and position hardware sprites
- Change sprite pointers and animate frames
- Handle collision detection and sprite priorities
- Experiment with sprite multiplexing for more than 8

Forget printing characters — now you’re *moving objects*. Real-time, pixel-perfect, and hardware-accelerated.
