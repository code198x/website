Time to build full applications.

You’ll:
- Use zero-page memory for efficient variable storage
- Structure routines into clean call trees
- Handle program entry, looping, subroutines, and exits
- Write to screen memory directly and manage system pointers

This is where you stop dabbling and start shipping real code.
