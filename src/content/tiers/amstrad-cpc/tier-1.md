Welcome to the Amstrad CPC, a machine that actually *wants* to help you learn.

You’ll:
- Load and run programs from tape or disk using `RUN"filename"`
- Use Amstrad BASIC to draw lines, circles, and text onscreen
- Explore the CPC's three screen modes and how they affect resolution and colour
- Save and reload your own programs to tape or disk image

The CPC gives you tools to build graphics-heavy programs right from Tier 1. Let’s start making things move and blink.
