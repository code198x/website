Make your pixels dance.

You’ll:
- Define sprite formats for 1bpp, 2bpp, or 4bpp modes
- Create fast blitting routines with masking and logic ops
- Animate sprites with frame tables and movement logic
- Handle background save/restore for smooth motion

The CPC doesn’t give you sprites — so we’ll build them ourselves.
