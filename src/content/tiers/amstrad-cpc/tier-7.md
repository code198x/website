Tier 7 gets you interacting with the outside world.

You’ll:
- Scan the keyboard matrix manually to detect keypresses
- Read joystick ports and map inputs to movement
- Build routines that debounce input and handle multiple keys
- Convert raw inputs into game logic events

Input is where code becomes gameplay — and you’ve now got the control scheme in your hands.
