Drawing with code, byte by byte.

You’ll:
- Learn how screen memory is laid out in different CPC screen modes
- Write routines to plot individual pixels and fill areas
- Create simple animation effects by updating screen data
- Use lookup tables and bit shifts for speed

The CPC’s flat RAM layout makes drawing in Z80 satisfying and fast. You’ll start seeing results immediately.
