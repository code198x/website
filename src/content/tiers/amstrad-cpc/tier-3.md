Time to live in Z80 full-time.

You’ll:
- Build clean Z80 assembly routines (no more inline BASIC)
- Write loops, branches, and subroutines in pure Z80
- Use `org`, macros, and assembler syntax for better structure
- Output to video RAM and interact with hardware ports directly

This tier is about structure. By the end, you’ll be writing real programs for a real system — no training wheels.
