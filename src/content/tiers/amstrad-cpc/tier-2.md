This tier gets you talking directly to the hardware.

You’ll:
- Use `PEEK` and `POKE` to manipulate screen memory and hardware ports
- Read the keyboard matrix and scan joystick ports
- Write short inline Z80 routines and call them using `CALL` or `USR`
- Observe how much faster even simple machine code is compared to BASIC

Think of it as learning to whisper in the CPC’s ear instead of shouting from BASIC.
