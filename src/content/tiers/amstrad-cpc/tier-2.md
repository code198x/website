This tier focuses on the next evolution of your Amstrad CPC dev skills.
You’ll:
- Apply lessons from earlier tiers in more structured and creative ways
- Gain insight into how to optimise your programs and manage resources
- Work with more advanced techniques such as graphics rendering, audio synthesis,
  memory management, or toolchain improvement depending on the tier
