Time to take on the AY chip.

You’ll:
- Understand the structure and purpose of the 14 sound registers
- Produce tone and noise on one or more channels
- Create looping or fading effects with amplitude envelopes
- Experiment with music routines using simple patterns

The CPC’s audio is far from silent — and now, neither are you.
