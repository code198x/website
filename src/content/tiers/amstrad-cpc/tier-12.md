Make the CPC feel like home.

You’ll:
- Use modern assemblers (like RASM or SDCC with CPC targets)
- Create scripts to compile and launch code in emulators
- Build your own sprite/tile/music editors for modern platforms
- Maintain your game/project with repeatable builds and debug output

No more manual conversions or command-line chaos. You’ll code faster — and better.
