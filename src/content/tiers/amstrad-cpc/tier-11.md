Fit more game into less RAM.

You’ll:
- Implement RLE and bit-packed compression for sprite and tile data
- Write a Z80 decompressor that runs at load time
- Split memory layouts for overlayed data sections
- Use asset converters to generate binary blobs from PNG/music/map files

This tier saves space without sacrificing ambition.
