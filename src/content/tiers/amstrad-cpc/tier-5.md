Tier 5 gives you total control of what goes onscreen.

You’ll:
- Explore the format and address layout of video memory in each screen mode
- Learn how pixels are packed in Mode 0, 1, and 2
- Change ink colours via hardware registers
- Use double buffering and fast memory clears

With its linear memory and flexible palette, the CPC rewards precision — and now you’ve got it.
