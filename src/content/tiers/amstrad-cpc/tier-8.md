Time to stop hacking and start building.

You’ll:
- Break your codebase into source modules and headers
- Use assembler macros and constants for readability
- Create and document a code style and memory map layout
- Maintain a project structure that supports growth and iteration

This is how large games and demos were built — not as monoliths, but as systems. Now yours will be too.
