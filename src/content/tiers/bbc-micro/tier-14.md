Time to control the beam.

You’ll:
- Hook into VSync and HSync via the CRTC\ n- Change palette or graphics mode mid-frame
- Create split-screen layouts for gameplay and UI
- Build smooth raster bars and colour gradients

Mastering interrupts and the CRTC is how you unlock the Beeb’s hidden visual power.
