This tier modernises your retro.

You’ll:
- Use assembler toolchains like BeebAsm or 64tass
- Automate builds with Make, shell scripts, or batch files
- Convert sprites, maps, and sound from modern formats
- Launch games in B-Em or jsBeeb for fast iteration

You’re not just making a game — you’re building a pipeline.
