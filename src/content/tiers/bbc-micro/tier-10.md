Time to draw on your own terms.

You’ll:
- Redefine ASCII characters to make graphics tiles
- Switch out the character set dynamically
- Lay out tilemaps using PRINT or direct memory writes
- Use BASIC and 6502 to mix tile logic and rendering

Custom characters are your first step toward real visuals — and they’re fast.
