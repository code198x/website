In Tier 15, everything comes together.

Youâ€™ll:
- Build a state-driven main loop with title, play, pause, and end states
- Create dynamic level loading and overlays
- Implement scoring, lives, and UI overlays
- Optimize performance and ensure stable timing

This is the production-ready framework for any BBC Micro game.
