Tier 13 is all about first impressions.

Youâ€™ll:
- Patch the OS vectors to redirect the boot process
- Write inline assembly or BASIC stubs that launch on reset
- Display graphics and play sound while loading assets
- Implement multi-stage loaders from disk or tape

By controlling what happens at power-on, you set the tone for everything that follows.
