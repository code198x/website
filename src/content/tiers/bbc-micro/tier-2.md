Direct control, done the BBC way.

You’ll:
- Use `?address` to PEEK and `?address=value` to POKE
- Explore I/O locations for keyboard, sound, and screen
- Write inline assembly using `[` and `]` blocks
- CALL machine code from BASIC, passing variables

This is a system built for learning — and hacking.
