Time to make some noise.

You’ll:
- Use the `SOUND` command for tones, noise, and effects
- Set envelopes with `ENVELOPE` to control volume and pitch over time
- Play multi-channel effects with different priorities
- Trigger sound from BASIC and assembly

The BBC’s audio might be simple — but it’s expressive, especially when layered.
