This is your final challenge.

You’ll:
- Use self-modifying code for speed or compactness
- Chain multiple effects with precise timing
- Compress code and data into minimal memory footprints
- Produce a complete .ssd or .dsd image ready for emulators or real hardware

Show the world what the BBC Micro is truly capable of — and what you’ve learned.
