Leave BASIC behind and go full 6502.

You’ll:
- Write loops, subroutines, and conditional branches
- Use zero page addressing for speed
- Print to the screen from machine code
- Create timing loops with `JMP` and `DEC` instructions

Assembly on the BBC is clean and fast — and you’re already making it work.
