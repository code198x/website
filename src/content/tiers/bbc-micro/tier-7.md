From scripts to systems.

Youâ€™ll:
- Use named labels and subroutines with `JSR`/`RTS`
- Organise code by function and memory section
- Use comments, constants, and macros (where supported)
- Lay out memory maps for RAM, screen, and I/O

Clean assembly code is easier to debug, extend, and share. This is your foundation.
