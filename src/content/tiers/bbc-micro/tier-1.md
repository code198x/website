The BBC Micro greets you with serious capability.

You’ll:
- Use `MODE` to switch between graphics and text modes
- Print text and draw lines, boxes, and circles
- Play sound and change pitch/duration
- Save and load your programs from DFS, ADFS, or virtual tape

This isn’t just BASIC — it’s structured, well-documented, and designed for real work. Let’s get comfortable.
