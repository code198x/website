Your first game skeleton is coming together.

You’ll:
- Build a classic game loop with input, update, and render phases
- Manage timers and delays for consistent timing
- Handle transitions between title, game, and end screens
- Create reusable logic for handling game state

It’s not fancy — yet. But it’s the real deal.
