Store more, load faster.

You’ll:
- Compress tilemaps and sprite data using RLE or simple LZ schemes
- Write Z80 decompressors that expand to VRAM or RAM
- Explore BLOAD and BSAVE formats for binary assets
- Optimise asset pipelines for size and speed

Compression isn’t just for big games — it’s for any good one.
