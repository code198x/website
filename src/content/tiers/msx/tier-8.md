Your MSX projects are growing up.

You’ll:
- Split your codebase into modules and labels
- Define macros and includes for reusable logic
- Build scripts to assemble and launch with openMSX
- Maintain memory maps, symbol tables, and versioning

This is how serious games got made — and how yours will too.
