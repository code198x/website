Tier 8: Structure and Scale

This tier focuses on the next evolution of your MSX dev skills.
You’ll:
- Apply lessons from earlier tiers in more structured and creative ways
- Gain insight into how to optimise your programs and manage resources
- Work with more advanced techniques such as graphics rendering, audio synthesis,
  memory management, or toolchain improvement depending on the tier

By the end of this tier, you’ll be significantly closer to professional-level MSX development.
