The MSX starts strong — with a structured, powerful BASIC that can do real work.

You’ll:
- Load and save programs to cassette or disk using `LOAD`, `SAVE`, `BLOAD`, and `BSAVE`
- Use `SCREEN` to switch graphics modes
- Draw lines, circles, and text using BASIC graphics commands
- Explore the MSX BIOS and how it provides hardware abstraction

MSX BASIC isn’t just a beginner’s tool — it’s a powerful gateway to the system’s core.
