Bring your tools up to speed.

You’ll:
- Set up modern Z80 assemblers with symbol support
- Use Python or Node.js to convert images, maps, and music
- Launch openMSX or fMSX from build scripts
- Maintain reusable toolchains for consistent builds

Tooling isn't cheating — it's how you get things done faster and better.
