The MSX makes Z80 programming clean — and lets you choose your level of abstraction.

You’ll:
- Write Z80 programs that hook into or bypass BIOS routines
- Use BIOS for screen, keyboard, and sprite access (or not)
- Explore slot-based memory addressing and RAM/ROM mapping
- Handle VDP I/O cleanly with status polling and register writes

Whether you go high-level or bare metal, you’re now writing real MSX software.
