Time to make things move.

You’ll:
- Define sprite patterns and colours in VRAM
- Use the sprite attribute table to control position and index
- Enable sprite display and manage screen priorities
- Detect sprite collisions using the status register

This is the start of real gameplay — hardware-accelerated and flicker-free.
