Input makes everything interactive.

You’ll:
- Use BIOS routines to read the keyboard and joystick
- Manually scan the keyboard matrix for performance
- Detect keypresses, releases, and combos
- Build an input abstraction layer for game logic

Whether it's buttons or sticks — your MSX is now listening.
