This is the final tier. Show us what the MSX can really do.

You’ll:
- Optimise graphics and code for memory and CPU cycles
- Use self-modifying routines and hand-crafted loops
- Compress the final build and deploy to .ROM or .DSK
- Build a full demo or game that showcases everything you’ve learned

You’ve got the tools. You’ve got the platform. Now make something unforgettable.
