The MSX BIOS makes hardware safer — but not slower.

You’ll:
- Use `POKE` to write directly to VRAM and key hardware registers
- Explore the BIOS CALL commands and what they abstract
- Call assembly routines from BASIC using `USR`
- Understand how MSX hides hardware differences behind its firmware

Tier 2 is about stretching BASIC as far as it can go — and then sneaking into machine code.
