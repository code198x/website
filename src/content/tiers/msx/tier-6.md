Get ready to score your games.

You’ll:
- Write values to the AY registers via ports `$A0` and `$A1`
- Generate tone, noise, and mixed output
- Use amplitude envelopes for fade, pulse, and sweep effects
- Sequence notes with frequency tables and tempo control

Three channels, full control — time to make the MSX sing.
