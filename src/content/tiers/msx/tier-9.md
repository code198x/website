The MSX doesn't scroll the screen — you scroll the world.

You’ll:
- Create tilemaps and draw them to VRAM dynamically
- Scroll by shifting name table entries, not pixels
- Update off-screen rows/columns for seamless motion
- Build tile-based engines for side-scrolling games

Scrolling is hard… unless you let the VDP do the heavy lifting.
