Your MSX game is about to grow up.

You’ll:
- Write a modular game loop with title, play, pause, and end states
- Implement transitions and overlay rendering
- Add scoring, lives, and gameplay UI
- Manage assets across levels and handle reloads

By the end of this tier, your game won’t just run — it’ll feel finished.
