Tier 2 cracks the case open.

You’ll:
- Learn how BASIC statements are tokenised and interpreted
- Explore the `USR` keyword and how it lets you call raw machine code
- Write your first Z80 routines using modern cross-assemblers
- Inject and execute simple machine code from BASIC programs

We’ll also look at why BASIC struggles with speed, and how assembly solves that. This tier is a taste of power — and the first step on a much faster road.
