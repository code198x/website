Welcome to the world of the ZX Spectrum — and welcome to Tier 1.

In this tier, you’ll:
- Learn how to load and save programs from tape (or virtual tape)
- Type in classic listings from magazines like *Sinclair Programs* or *INPUT*
- Use line numbers, GOTO/GOSUB, and PRINT to build your first BASIC programs
- Begin exploring memory layout, screen modes, and the layout of the keyboard

This isn’t about building perfect software. This is about nostalgia, friction, and laying a foundation. By the end, you’ll know your way around BASIC — and be itching to go deeper.
