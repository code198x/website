system: "zx-spectrum"

order: 14
description: "You’ll go beyond the intended use of the ULA. Explore raster bars, colour splits, timing tricks, and floating bus effects to do what shouldn’t be possible."

Tier 14 breaks the rules — and the screen border.

You’ll:
- Use cycle-counted timing to control colour changes per scanline
- Build raster bars and shimmering effects
- Harness floating bus reads for display hacks
- Combine interrupt timing and screen writes for animation tricks

These are the techniques that defined the demoscene. Pure black magic, executed one frame at a time.
