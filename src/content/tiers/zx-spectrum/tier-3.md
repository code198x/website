Welcome to real development on the Spectrum.

This tier covers:
- Full program structure in Z80 assembly
- Calling and returning between routines, with registers preserved
- Stack discipline, memory layout, and register usage conventions
- Tools: assembler, linker, binary injector, emulator

By the end of Tier 3, you'll be writing clean, repeatable assembly code that could slot into a game, a tool, or even a tiny OS of your own.
