system: "zx-spectrum"

description: "The Spectrum doesn’t have a sound chip — but that won’t stop you. You’ll generate square waves, noise, and even music using timing loops and the BEEP command."

Tier 6 teaches sound the hard way: one cycle at a time.

You’ll:
- Create tone and noise using software delay loops
- Use `BEEP` from BASIC — and then rebuild it in Z80
- Explore duty cycles and waveform generation using OUT
- Simulate percussion, melody, and even early music playback

All with nothing but the CPU. Welcome to the DIY sound chip experience.
