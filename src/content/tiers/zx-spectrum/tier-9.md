Tier 9 is all about precision timing.

You’ll:
- Understand the ULA timing model and refresh cycles
- Hook into vertical blank interrupts for logic and rendering
- Build smooth animation systems synced to refresh
- Explore basic raster effects and double buffering techniques

Mastering timing is how you unlock fluid visuals and responsive gameplay. This is where amateur code starts to feel professional.
