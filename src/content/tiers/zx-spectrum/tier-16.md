Tier 16 is your ZX Spectrum endgame.

You’ll:
- Write self-modifying code for space or speed
- Chain compression and decompression during execution
- Create multistage loaders for demo/game transitions
- Exploit undocumented instructions and side effects

This is the machine at its absolute limit — and you, fully in control of every cycle, every byte, and every glitch. There’s nothing left to learn but everything left to build.
