Pixels. Blocks. Flicker. Welcome to the screen memory of the ZX Spectrum.

In this tier:
- Understand the screen memory layout: 256×192 pixels, split into rows and thirds
- Write routines to plot individual pixels
- Work with the attribute map to set foreground/background colours
- Build basic animations by modifying pixel data on the fly

This is where things get visual — and a little bit dirty. You’ll start to appreciate why so many games went for black backgrounds and limited colour movement. And you’ll learn how to fight back.
