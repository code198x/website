Tier 11 teaches you how to fit more into less.

You’ll:
- Explore compression formats used in 80s games
- Build a simple RLE compressor and decompressor
- Write your own decompression routines in Z80
- Compress sprites, level maps, and even sound data

This isn’t optional — it’s how pros packed full games into a single side of tape.
