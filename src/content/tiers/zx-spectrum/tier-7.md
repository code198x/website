Tier 7 is where interaction becomes real.

You’ll:
- Understand the keyboard matrix and how to scan it with IN/OUT
- Build your own debounce routines
- Map raw keypresses to game controls or editor commands
- Learn how to handle multiple simultaneous keypresses

This tier sets you up for full game loops and smooth player control — without relying on BASIC polling.
