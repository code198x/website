description: "Why stop at games when you can build the loader too? In this tier, you’ll hook or override ROM routines, build your own splash screens, and control the load process."

Tier 13 puts you in charge of what happens *before* the game even starts.

You’ll:
- Write custom tape loaders with visual effects
- Inject graphics and music into the load screen
- Override ROM routines with your own entry points
- Replace the default startup to boot directly into your program

It’s a true badge of honour to customise the full loading experience. This is how classics made a first impression.
