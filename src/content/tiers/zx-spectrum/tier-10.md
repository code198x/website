In Tier 10, you build a software sprite engine from the ground up.

You’ll:
- Design sprite data formats and loading systems
- Implement drawing with XOR and OR masking
- Use dirty rectangles to minimise redraw regions
- Handle sprite movement, animation, and basic collisions

Once you’ve built your own sprite handler, every platformer or shooter becomes possible. It’s the beginning of real game development.
