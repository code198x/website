Tier 8 is about thinking like a systems developer.

You’ll:
- Break your project into modules and libraries
- Create include files and macros for shared definitions
- Use the assembler's features for labels, conditionals, and macros
- Maintain clean call trees and structured memory maps

This is where you stop writing code and start building systems. It’s essential before moving into game engines, loaders, and toolchains.
