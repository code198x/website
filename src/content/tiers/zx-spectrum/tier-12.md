In Tier 12, you’ll stop working like it’s 198x (just a little).

You’ll:
- Write sprite and tile editors for your PC
- Automate asset conversion for tape loading or binary injection
- Use Makefiles or scripts to compile, compress, and test
- Create workflows to speed up iteration and debugging

This is how modern retro devs work. Your Spectrum code will still be 8-bit — but your tools won’t be.
