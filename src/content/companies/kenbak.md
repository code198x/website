**Kenbak Corporation** was a short-lived computer company founded by John Blankenbaker around 1970 in California. Though it existed for only a few years and sold fewer than 50 machines, its sole productâ€”the **Kenbak-1**â€”is widely recognised as the **first personal computer**.

Released in 1971, the Kenbak-1 predated the microprocessor era, relying instead on TTL logic to perform computations. It featured just 256 bytes of memory and was programmed using switches and indicator lights. Despite its extremely limited capabilities by modern standards, it was a major conceptual breakthrough in affordable, personal computing.

The Kenbak-1 was primarily sold to educational institutions and hobbyists. With the emergence of microprocessor-based designs like the Altair 8800 in the mid-1970s, Kenbak Corporation quickly faded from relevance. Today, original units are rare and highly prized by collectors.
