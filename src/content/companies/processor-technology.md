**Processor Technology** was a key player in the early personal computer era, founded in 1975 in Berkeley, California by Gary Ingram and Bob Marsh. The company originally specialised in S-100 expansion cards for the Altair 8800 and IMSAI 8080, most notably the 3P+S and the VDM-1, which allowed microcomputers to display video output.

Their best-known product, the **SOL-20**, launched in 1976, was one of the first all-in-one microcomputers with a built-in keyboard and video output. Designed by Lee Felsenstein (of later Homebrew Computer Club fame), the SOL-20 was well-received by hobbyists and educational institutions alike.

Processor Technology's innovative designs were unfortunately hampered by business and supply chain challenges. The company dissolved in 1979, but its legacy lives on in early video terminals and integrated personal computer design.
