**Radio Shack**, owned by Tandy Corporation, played a pivotal role in bringing personal computers to the masses during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Originally founded as a retailer in 1919, Radio Shack was acquired by Tandy in 1963 and later used as the retail arm for Tandyâ€™s growing line of consumer electronics.

In 1977, Radio Shack introduced the **TRS-80 Model I**, one of the earliest mass-market personal computers and part of the so-called "1977 Trinity" alongside the Apple II and Commodore PET. Sold through over 3,000 Radio Shack stores, it brought computing into homes and classrooms across the United States.

Tandy continued to develop the TRS-80 line through the 1980s, including business and colour models. Later machines like the **Tandy 1000** were IBM PC-compatible and aimed at budget-conscious users. Radio Shack's unique position as both manufacturer and distributor helped shape early consumer access to personal technology.
