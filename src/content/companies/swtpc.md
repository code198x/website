**Southwest Technical Products Corporation** (SWTPc) was a pioneering company in the early microcomputer era. Founded in 1964 by Daniel Meyer in San Antonio, Texas, SWTPc initially sold DIY electronics kits, including test equipment and audio gear, through magazines like *Popular Electronics*.

The company entered the computer market in 1975 with the **SWTPc 6800**, based on the Motorola 6800 CPU. It was one of the earliest affordable microcomputers and helped popularise the **SS-50 bus**, which enabled a modular system architecture. SWTPc followed up with the more powerful **SWTPc 6809**, and briefly offered full computer systems aimed at small businesses and hobbyists.

Despite its early success, the company struggled to compete with rising giants like Apple and Commodore. SWTPc eventually transitioned to the name Point Systems before fading from the market in the early 1980s.
