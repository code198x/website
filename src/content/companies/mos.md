**MOS Technology** was an American semiconductor company founded in 1969, originally producing calculator chips and custom integrated circuits. Its lasting fame came in 1975 with the introduction of the **MOS 6502**, a revolutionary 8-bit microprocessor that drastically undercut competitors in price while offering excellent performance.

The 6502 powered many of the most famous early home computers, including the Apple I and II, Commodore PET, VIC-20, Commodore 64, Atari 2600, BBC Micro, and the Nintendo Entertainment System. Its affordability and performance helped fuel the personal computer boom of the late 1970s and early 1980s.

In addition to the 6502, MOS produced other essential chips like the **KIM-1** development board, as well as peripheral chips like the 6522 VIA and 6532 RIOT. The company was acquired by Commodore in 1976, becoming its in-house chip design team and continuing to supply the semiconductor backbone of Commodoreâ€™s entire product line.

## ðŸ’¡ Did You Know?

- The MOS 6502 was designed by ex-Motorola engineers who had worked on the 6800.
- At launch, the 6502 sold for just $25, compared to the $175 price tag of its competitors.
- Chuck Peddle, often credited as the architect of the 6502, also helped design the PET using MOS parts.
