**Apple Computer, Inc.** was founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in a California garage. Their first product, the Apple I, was a bare circuit board aimed at hobbyistsâ€”but the follow-up, the Apple II, became one of the first mass-market home computers.

In 1984, Apple launched the **Macintosh**, the first successful personal computer with a graphical user interface and mouse. Although the early years were marked by both innovation and internal conflictâ€”including Jobs' ousting in 1985â€”the company remained a significant player in education and creative industries.

After Jobs' return in 1997, Apple was transformed through iconic products like the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad. These cemented its status as one of the most influential tech companies in history. Though officially renamed simply "Apple Inc." in 2007 to reflect its broadening focus beyond computers, its roots in the 1970s PC revolution remain deeply influential.
