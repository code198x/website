**Commodore** was one of the most important players in the personal computing revolution of the 1970s and 1980s. Founded by Jack Tramiel in 1954 originally as a typewriter and calculator company, Commodore pivoted into the home computer market in the mid-1970s following the success of early kits and micros.

The **Commodore PET** was one of the first all-in-one home computers. Its success was followed by the hugely popular **VIC-20** and the legendary **Commodore 64**, which remains the best-selling single model of computer ever made.

Commodoreâ€™s later acquisition of Amiga Corporation brought the **Amiga** line of computers into the foldâ€”powerful multimedia systems that were ahead of their time, especially in graphics and audio.

Despite its dominance, internal power struggles and poor management decisions in the early 1990s led to Commodoreâ€™s decline and bankruptcy in 1994. Its legacy remains strong, particularly among retro computing enthusiasts.
