**MITS** (Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems) was a pioneering electronics company founded in 1969 by Ed Roberts in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Originally focused on calculator kits and telemetry devices, MITS would go on to launch the **Altair 8800** in 1975â€”widely regarded as the spark that ignited the personal computer revolution.

The Altair 8800, featured on the cover of *Popular Electronics* magazine, was a build-it-yourself computer kit based on the Intel 8080. It inspired thousands of hobbyists and gave rise to the S-100 bus standard. The Altairâ€™s popularity also drew the attention of Paul Allen and Bill Gates, who offered to create a BASIC interpreter for itâ€”leading to the founding of Microsoft.

MITS was acquired by Pertec in 1977, and its influence declined soon after. Nonetheless, its role in PC history is monumental.
