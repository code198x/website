**IMSAI** (Information Management Sciences of America, Inc.) was an early personal computer company founded in 1973 by William Millard. The company became widely known for the **IMSAI 8080**, released in 1975 as a clone and enhancement of the MITS Altair 8800. It was one of the first commercially successful microcomputers and helped popularise the S-100 bus standard.

The IMSAI 8080 featured a more robust chassis, a clearer front panel interface, and greater expandability than its Altair predecessor, making it a favorite among hobbyists and early developers. It was also featured prominently in popular culture, most famously in the 1983 film *WarGames*.

IMSAI later attempted to enter the business computing market with products like the VDP-80, but struggled against emerging competitors. The company faded in the early 1980s and was dissolved by the mid-decade.
