**Steve Jobs** was one of the most iconic and visionary figures in the history of computing. Born in 1955 in California, he co-founded Apple Inc. with Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne in 1976. Jobs helped launch the Apple I and Apple II, which were instrumental in popularising personal computing in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

After internal tensions, Jobs left Apple in 1985 and founded NeXT, a company whose software and hardware innovations later formed the foundation for modern macOS. He also acquired and nurtured Pixar, helping it grow into a powerhouse of digital animation with hits like *Toy Story*.

Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, rescuing the company from near bankruptcy and leading it through a golden age of innovation. Under his leadership, Apple introduced the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad, reshaping industries and everyday life.
