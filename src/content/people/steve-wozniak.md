**Steve Wozniak**, affectionately known as "Woz," is one of the most important figures in early personal computing history. Born in 1950 in California, he co-founded Apple Inc. in 1976 with Steve Jobs and Ronald Wayne. While Jobs was the visionary entrepreneur, Wozniak was the engineering genius who designed and built the Apple I and Apple II computers almost entirely on his own.

The Apple II in particular became one of the first mass-market home computers, thanks to its integrated design, color graphics, and expandability. Wozâ€™s efficient, elegant engineering helped make computing accessible to a wide audience and laid the groundwork for the entire Apple ecosystem.

After a plane crash in 1981, Wozniak gradually stepped back from Apple and later focused on education, philanthropy, and speaking engagements. He remains a beloved figure in tech culture for his humility, creativity, and lasting contributions to the industry.
