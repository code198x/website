IBM's entry into the personal computer market in 1981 marked a watershed moment in computing history. Though the company was already a computing giant in mainframes and business machines, the IBM PC created a standard that would dominate personal computing for decades to come.

## Key Contributions

- Created the IBM PC architecture that became the industry standard
- Established the open architecture approach that enabled the PC clone market
- Partnered with Microsoft for DOS, helping establish the software giant
- Developed advanced technologies like the ISA bus and VGA graphics

## Historical Impact

IBM's decision to use an open architecture and off-the-shelf components created the entire PC-compatible industry. This choice led to rapid innovation and price competition, though it eventually cost IBM its dominance in the personal computer market.

## Legacy

While IBM eventually sold its PC division to Lenovo in 2005, its influence on personal computing cannot be overstated. The IBM PC architecture became the foundation for modern computing, and many of its design decisions continue to influence computer design today. The term "IBM PC Compatible" became synonymous with personal computing, creating a standard that enabled the massive growth of the personal computer industry.
