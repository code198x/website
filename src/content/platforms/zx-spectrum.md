The Sinclair ZX Spectrum, affectionately known as the "Speccy", was launched in the UK in 1982 by Sinclair Research Ltd. It became one of the most influential home computers of the 1980s, especially in Europe.

## Key Features:

*   **Processor:** Zilog Z80A @ 3.5 MHz
*   **Memory:** Initially available with 16 KB or 48 KB RAM.
*   **Graphics:** 256Ã—192 pixels resolution with 15 colours (8 basic colours in normal and bright modes). Known for its characteristic "attribute clash" where colour information was stored separately from pixel data.
*   **Sound:** Simple beeper capable of single-channel sound.
*   **Storage:** Primarily used cassette tapes for loading and saving software.
*   **Keyboard:** Distinctive rubber chiclet keyboard on the original models.

## Significance:

The ZX Spectrum was designed to be affordable, making home computing accessible to a wide audience. It fostered a generation of programmers and game developers, particularly in the UK, thanks to its relatively low cost and the inclusion of Sinclair BASIC.

A vast library of software, especially games, was developed for the platform. Despite its limitations compared to rivals like the Commodore 64, its unique charm and affordability secured its place in computing history.

Later models, such as the ZX Spectrum 128 and the Amstrad-produced +2 and +3 models, added more memory, improved sound capabilities (AY-3-8912 chip), and built-in storage (tape or disk drives).
