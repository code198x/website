The Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), known as the Super Famicom in Japan, is a 16-bit home video game console developed by Nintendo. Released in 1990 in Japan, 1991 in North America, and 1992 in Europe, it was the successor to the NES and Nintendo's entry into the 16-bit era.

## Key Features:

*   **Processor:** Custom Ricoh 5A22, based on the WDC 65C816 core, running at variable speeds up to 3.58 MHz.
*   **Memory:** 128 KB Main RAM, 64 KB Video RAM, 64 KB Audio RAM.
*   **Graphics:** Two custom Picture Processing Units (PPUs). Supported multiple background layers, advanced tilemapping, transparency effects, a palette of 32,768 colors (typically 256 on-screen), and the famous "Mode 7" scaling and rotation effect for backgrounds.
*   **Sound:** Sony SPC700 8-bit processor controlling a custom S-DSP chip. Provided 8 channels of sample-based synthesis with echo/reverb effects, delivering significantly richer audio than most contemporaries.
*   **Storage:** Game cartridges. Many cartridges included enhancement chips (like the Super FX chip for 3D graphics) to augment the console's capabilities.

## Significance:

The SNES was a critical and commercial success, selling nearly 50 million units worldwide. It competed fiercely with the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive in the famous "console wars" of the early 1990s. Its powerful graphics (especially Mode 7) and high-quality sampled audio defined the look and sound of many classic 16-bit games (e.g., Super Mario World, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Super Metroid, Chrono Trigger).

Nintendo's continued focus on strong first-party titles and select third-party relationships resulted in a highly regarded game library.
