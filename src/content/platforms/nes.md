The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), originally released as the Family Computer (Famicom) in Japan in 1983, is an 8-bit home video game console developed and manufactured by Nintendo. It was launched in North America in 1985 and Europe/Australia in 1986/1987.

## Key Features:

*   **Processor:** Custom Ricoh 2A03 (NTSC) / 2A07 (PAL), based on MOS Technology 6502 core, running at ~1.79 MHz (NTSC) / ~1.66 MHz (PAL).
*   **Memory:** 2 KB onboard Work RAM, 2 KB Video RAM.
*   **Graphics:** Custom Picture Processing Unit (PPU) by Ricoh. Supports 64 sprites (8 per scanline), tile-based backgrounds, scrolling, and a palette of 54 colors (though with limitations on simultaneous colors).
*   **Sound:** Integrated into the CPU chip (2A03/2A07). Provides 5 sound channels: 2 pulse wave, 1 triangle wave, 1 noise, and 1 DPCM sample playback channel.
*   **Storage:** Game cartridges (ROMs) containing the game code and data. Cartridges could also include extra hardware like mapper chips for expanded capabilities or additional RAM.

## Significance:

The NES is credited with revitalizing the US video game industry following the crash of 1983. Its high-quality games (like Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda, Metroid), strict quality control for third-party publishers, and iconic design led to immense popularity. It established many long-running game franchises and set standards for console game design and business practices.

Developing for the NES involves working directly with its hardware limitations and quirks, particularly the PPU.
