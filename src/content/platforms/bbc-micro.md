The BBC Microcomputer System, or BBC Micro, was developed and built by Acorn Computers Ltd for the BBC Computer Literacy Project in the United Kingdom. Launched in late 1981, it became a fixture in schools across the UK.

## Key Features (Model B):

*   **Processor:** MOS Technology 6502 @ 2 MHz
*   **Memory:** 32 KB RAM (Model B), 16 KB RAM (Model A), 32 KB ROM (containing the OS and BBC BASIC).
*   **Graphics:** Multiple screen modes (numbered MODE 0 to MODE 7) offering various resolutions and colour depths, ranging from 640×256 monochrome to 160×256 with 8 colours (plus flashing combinations).
*   **Sound:** Texas Instruments SN76489 chip providing 3 square wave channels and 1 noise channel.
*   **Storage:** Cassette tape interface standard; floppy disk drives were a common expansion.
*   **Expansion:** Known for its extensive expansion capabilities, including the Tube interface for second processors (like a Z80 or a 6502).

## Significance:

The BBC Micro played a crucial role in computer education in the UK. Its advanced BBC BASIC interpreter was powerful and easy to use, encouraging many students to learn programming. Its sturdy construction and expandability made it a versatile machine, used not only for education but also for scientific research and broadcasting control.

Many iconic British games, such as Elite, were first developed on the BBC Micro. The later Acorn Archimedes series was its successor.
