The Apple II series, designed primarily by Steve Wozniak, was launched by Apple Computer in 1977. It was one of the first commercially successful personal computers and enjoyed a long production run with various models extending into the early 1990s.

Key models include the original Apple II, Apple II+, Apple IIe, Apple IIc, and the 16-bit Apple IIGS.

## Key Features (Apple IIe):

*   **Processor:** MOS Technology 6502 @ 1.023 MHz
*   **Memory:** 64 KB RAM (IIe, expandable), 16 KB ROM (containing Applesoft BASIC and monitor).
*   **Graphics:** Several modes, including low-resolution (40×48, 15 colors), high-resolution (280×192, 6 colors), and later double-high-resolution on the IIe. Known for its quirky color generation tied to pixel positioning.
*   **Sound:** Simple single-channel speaker toggled via memory location.
*   **Storage:** Cassette interface standard initially; the Disk II 5.25-inch floppy drive became ubiquitous and crucial to its success.
*   **Expansion:** Eight expansion slots on the II/II+/IIe provided significant hardware flexibility.

## Significance:

The Apple II was instrumental in launching the personal computer revolution. Its open architecture (via expansion slots), readily available technical information, and the arrival of VisiCalc (the first killer app spreadsheet program) made it popular in homes, schools, and businesses. The Apple IIe, in particular, became a standard in North American education for many years.

It established Apple as a major player in the industry and laid the groundwork for the Macintosh.
