The Nintendo Game Boy is an 8-bit handheld game console developed and manufactured by Nintendo. Released in Japan and North America in 1989, and Europe in 1990, it became a cultural phenomenon and one of the best-selling electronic devices of all time.

*   **Processor:** Custom Sharp LR35902 @ ~4.19 MHz (a hybrid between Intel 8080 and Zilog Z80).
*   **Memory:** 8 KB Work RAM, 8 KB Video RAM.
*   **Graphics:** Reflective STN LCD display. Resolution 160×144 pixels. 4 shades of monochrome "color" (olive green on the original).
*   **Sound:** 4 channels: 2 pulse wave, 1 programmable wave, 1 noise channel. Stereo sound via headphones.
*   **Storage:** ROM cartridges (Game Paks).
*   **Power:** 4 AA batteries providing notoriously long battery life (15-30 hours).

## Significance:

The Game Boy, bundled initially with Tetris, became an instant success. Its durability, relatively low cost, long battery life, and compelling game library (including Pokémon later in its lifespan) made it the undisputed king of handheld gaming throughout the 1990s. It spawned several revisions, including the Game Boy Pocket and Game Boy Color.

Development involves working within tight memory constraints and the limitations of the monochrome display.
