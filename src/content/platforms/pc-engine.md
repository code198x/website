The PC Engine is a home video game console developed jointly by Hudson Soft and NEC Home Electronics, released in Japan in 1987. It was later released in North America in 1989 as the TurboGrafx-16.

Despite its marketing as a 16-bit console (due to its 16-bit graphics processor), its main CPU was an 8-bit chip.

## Key Features:

*   **Processor:** Hudson Soft HuC6280 (8-bit, based on WDC 65C02) running at ~7.16 MHz.
*   **Memory:** 8 KB Work RAM, 64 KB Video RAM.
*   **Graphics:** Dual 16-bit graphics processors (HuC6270 VDC and HuC6260 VCE). Supported high resolutions (up to 512×240), large sprites, multiple background layers, and a palette of 512 colors (typically up to 482 on-screen simultaneously).
*   **Sound:** 6 channels of wavetable synthesis sound integrated into the HuC6280 CPU.
*   **Storage:** Credit card-sized HuCards (ROM cartridges). A popular CD-ROM² System add-on was released later, significantly expanding game size and adding Red Book CD audio capabilities.

## Significance:

The PC Engine was remarkably compact yet powerful for its time. It was highly successful in Japan, outselling the Famicom for a period and strongly competing with the later Super Famicom and Mega Drive. It gained a reputation for excellent arcade conversions and particularly strong shoot 'em up games.

In North America, the TurboGrafx-16 faced challenges due to marketing issues, limited third-party support compared to Nintendo/Sega, and a higher price point, leading to less commercial success than in Japan.
