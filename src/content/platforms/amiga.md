The Commodore Amiga is a family of personal computers introduced by Commodore in 1985 with the Amiga 1000. The line became famous for its advanced graphical and sound capabilities, and its pre-emptive multitasking operating system (AmigaOS), which were significantly ahead of most competitors at the time.

Popular models included the Amiga 500 (1987), the compact Amiga 600 (1992), and the more powerful Amiga 1200 (1992) which featured the improved AGA chipset.

## Key Features (Amiga 500):

*   **Processor:** Motorola 68000 @ ~7.16 MHz (NTSC) / ~7.09 MHz (PAL)
*   **Memory:** 512 KB Chip RAM (shared between CPU and custom chips), expandable to 1MB Chip RAM + Fast RAM.
*   **Custom Chips (OCS - Original Chip Set):**
    *   **Agnus:** Memory controller, DMA controller, Copper (co-processor for display effects), Blitter (fast memory block moving/modification).
    *   **Denise:** Video display processor. Supported multiple resolutions, up to 32 colors from a palette of 4096 (or 64 in EHB mode), hardware sprites.
    *   **Paula:** Audio and I/O controller. Provided 4 channels of 8-bit PCM sound (2 left, 2 right), floppy disk control, serial port, etc.
*   **Storage:** Built-in 3.5-inch floppy disk drive (880 KB).

## Key Features (Amiga 1200):

*   **Storage:** Built-in 3.5-inch HD floppy drive (1.76 MB), internal IDE connector for hard drives.

## Significance:

The Amiga was a pioneer in multimedia computing. Its advanced custom hardware made it a favourite for games, video production (e.g., Video Toaster), and the demoscene. While it struggled commercially in North America against entrenched PCs and Macs, it was hugely popular in Europe throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s.
