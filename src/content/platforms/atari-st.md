The Atari ST is a line of 16/32-bit personal computers from Atari Corporation, launched in 1985. Often seen as a direct competitor to the Commodore Amiga and Apple Macintosh, the ST found its niche particularly among musicians due to its built-in MIDI ports.

Key models include the 520ST, 1040ST (the first home computer to ship with 1MB of RAM), the enhanced STE series, the portable STacy/STBook, and the powerful Mega ST/STE and TT030/Falcon030 models.

## Key Features (1040STF):

*   **Processor:** Motorola 68000 @ 8 MHz
*   **Memory:** 1 MB RAM (1040ST models), 512 KB (520ST models).
*   **Graphics:** Custom shifter chip. Supported several resolutions:
    *   Low Res: 320×200, 16 colors (from a palette of 512)
    *   Medium Res: 640×200, 4 colors (from 512)
    *   High Res: 640×400, Monochrome (primarily for desktop/productivity)
*   **Sound:** Yamaha YM2149 PSG chip (similar to AY-3-8910), providing 3 square wave channels plus noise.
*   **Operating System:** Atari TOS (The Operating System) featuring Digital Research's GEM (Graphical Environment Manager) windowing system.
*   **Storage:** Built-in 3.5-inch floppy disk drive. External hard drives were common.
*   **Connectivity:** Crucially included built-in MIDI In/Out ports.

## Significance:

The Atari ST offered significant computing power for its price point. Its clean monochrome high-resolution display made it suitable for desktop publishing and CAD work, while the integrated MIDI ports, combined with software like Cubase and Logic Pro (which originated on the ST), made it the dominant platform for home music sequencing and production for many years.

While its gaming library was extensive, it was often perceived as having slightly less advanced graphics and sound for games compared to the Amiga.
