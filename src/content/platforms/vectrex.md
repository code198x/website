The Vectrex is a unique home video game console developed by Smith Engineering and distributed first by General Consumer Electronics (GCE) in 1982, and later by Milton Bradley Company after their acquisition of GCE.

Its defining feature is its integrated vector monitor, which displays graphics composed of lines drawn point-to-point, rather than the raster graphics (pixels) used by virtually all other home systems.

## Key Features:

*   **Processor:** Motorola 68A09 @ 1.5 MHz
*   **Memory:** 1 KB RAM, 8 KB ROM (containing the executive "Mine Storm" game and system functions).
*   **Display:** Built-in Samsung 9-inch monochrome vector CRT monitor.
*   **Graphics:** Handled by the CPU driving the vector generation hardware. Graphics are drawn as lines (vectors). Colored overlays were included with games to simulate color on the monochrome screen.
*   **Sound:** General Instrument AY-3-8912 PSG chip (similar to Amstrad CPC/MSX).
*   **Storage:** Game cartridges.
*   **Controller:** Analog joystick controller that could be stored in the base of the unit.

## Significance:

The Vectrex stands out for its vector display technology, offering a distinct visual style reminiscent of arcade games like Asteroids or Tempest. Being a self-contained unit with its own screen was also unusual. Despite positive reviews for its technical capabilities and unique display, it was a commercial failure, caught in the midst of the 1983 video game crash and overshadowed by raster-based systems.

It retains a dedicated cult following today due to its uniqueness. Development involves understanding vector drawing principles rather than pixel manipulation.
