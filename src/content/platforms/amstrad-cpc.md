The Amstrad CPC (Colour Personal Computer) series was launched by British company Amstrad in 1984. It was designed as an all-in-one system, typically sold with its own dedicated monochrome or colour monitor which also housed the power supply, and integrated storage (cassette deck or 3-inch floppy disk drive).

## Key Features (CPC 464):

*   **Processor:** Zilog Z80 @ 4 MHz
*   **Memory:** 64 KB RAM, 32 KB ROM.
*   **Graphics:** Motorola 6845 CRTC. Supported multiple screen modes, including a 160×200 mode with 16 colors (from a palette of 27) and a 640×200 mode with 2 colors.
*   **Sound:** General Instrument AY-3-8912 chip providing 3 channels of square wave sound plus a noise channel.
*   **Storage:** Integrated cassette deck (CPC 464) or 3-inch floppy disk drive (CPC 664, 6128).

## Significance:

The Amstrad CPC range was particularly successful in Europe, especially in the UK, France, Spain, and Germany. Its all-in-one design made it simple to set up. The generous RAM (for the time) and capable graphics and sound made it a favourite platform for game developers, resulting in a large and diverse software library.

Later models like the CPC 6128 offered more RAM (128 KB) and a built-in disk drive.
