The Acorn Archimedes was a family of personal computers designed by Acorn Computers Ltd in the UK and released starting in 1987. They were the successors to Acorn's popular BBC Micro range and were notable for being the first home computers based on Acorn's own ARM (Acorn RISC Machine) processor architecture.

Key models included the A300 series, A400 series, A3000, A5000, and later the RiscPC line which continued the architecture.

## Key Features (A3000):

*   **Processor:** Acorn ARM2 @ 8 MHz (32-bit RISC).
*   **Memory:** 1 MB RAM standard (expandable).
*   **Custom Chips (MEMC, VIDC, IOC):**
    *   **MEMC:** Memory controller.
    *   **VIDC:** Video and sound controller. Supported multiple high-resolution screen modes (up to 640Ã—512 or higher with overscan) with up to 256 colors from a palette of 4096.
    *   **IOC:** Input/Output controller.
*   **Sound:** Handled by VIDC, providing 8 channels of 8-bit sampled sound.
*   **Operating System:** Arthur OS initially, quickly superseded by RISC OS, a sophisticated multitasking GUI operating system stored in ROM.
*   **Storage:** Single 3.5-inch floppy disk drive. Hard drives were common additions, especially on higher-end models.

## Significance:

The Archimedes range offered significantly higher performance than most contemporary 16-bit machines due to its efficient ARM RISC processor. It gained popularity in the UK education market, following the legacy of the BBC Micro, and also found use in specialist niches like broadcast television. The ARM architecture developed for the Archimedes went on to become the most widely used processor architecture in the world, powering billions of mobile phones and embedded devices today.

Despite its technical prowess, the Archimedes struggled to gain mainstream adoption outside the UK education sector against the dominance of IBM PC compatibles and the Apple Macintosh.
