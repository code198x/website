The Sharp X68000 is a home computer released exclusively in Japan by Sharp Corporation, with the first model launched in 1987. It was based on the Motorola 68000 CPU and featured impressive graphics and sound capabilities for its time, closely mirroring the hardware of many contemporary arcade systems.

## Key Features (Original X68000):

*   **Processor:** Motorola 68000 @ 10 MHz (later models up to 25 MHz 68030).
*   **Memory:** 1 MB RAM standard (expandable up to 12 MB).
*   **Graphics:** Custom graphics hardware capable of high resolutions (up to 768Ã—512), large color palettes (65,536 colors), hardware sprites, scrolling, and scaling/rotation capabilities similar to arcade boards.
*   **Sound:** Yamaha YM2151 FM synthesis chip (8 channels) + OKI MSM6258 ADPCM chip for sampled sounds.
*   **Operating System:** Human68k (an MS-DOS-like command-line OS developed by Hudson Soft) and optional visual shells (like SX-WINDOW).
*   **Storage:** Dual 5.25-inch floppy disk drives. Hard drives were optional.

## Significance:

The X68000 gained fame primarily for its ability to host incredibly accurate conversions of arcade games from companies like Capcom, Konami, Taito, and Irem. For many Japanese gamers, it was the ultimate home platform for playing arcade hits. Its high price kept it out of the mainstream, but it became a coveted machine for enthusiasts and developers.

It was also used as a development system for Capcom's CPS arcade board. Its distinctive twin vertical tower case design is also iconic.
