The Classic Macintosh refers to the series of personal computers designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc., starting with the original Macintosh 128K launched in January 1984. These machines, based on the Motorola 68000 family of processors, are notable for popularizing the graphical user interface (GUI).

Key models include the Macintosh 128K, 512K, Plus, SE, SE/30, Classic, Classic II, LC series, II series, and early PowerBooks.

## Key Features (Macintosh SE):

*   **Processor:** Motorola 68000 @ 8 MHz
*   **Memory:** 1 MB RAM standard (expandable to 4 MB).
*   **Display:** Built-in 9-inch monochrome CRT display, 512Ã—342 pixels.
*   **Graphics:** Integrated graphics controlled directly by the CPU and custom logic.
*   **Sound:** 4-voice synthesis sound capabilities via custom Apple sound chip.
*   **Operating System:** System Software (later Mac OS) featuring the iconic graphical user interface.
*   **Storage:** Initially single 800 KB 3.5-inch floppy drive; SE models offered dual floppies or one floppy plus an internal SCSI hard drive (20-40 MB).
*   **Expansion:** The SE was the first compact Mac with an internal expansion slot (Processor Direct Slot).

## Significance:

The Macintosh revolutionized personal computing by introducing a user-friendly graphical interface (windows, icons, menus, pointer - WIMP) operated with a mouse, making computers accessible to non-technical users. While not the first computer with a GUI, its marketing and design made these concepts mainstream.

It became a dominant platform in desktop publishing, education, and creative fields. The event-driven programming model required for GUI applications represented a significant shift from earlier procedural programming styles.
