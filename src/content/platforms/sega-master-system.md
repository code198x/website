The Sega Master System (SMS) is an 8-bit home video game console developed and released by Sega. It was originally released in Japan in 1985 as the Sega Mark III. The redesigned Master System launched in North America in 1986 and in Europe in 1987.

## Key Features:

*   **Processor:** Zilog Z80A @ ~3.58 MHz
*   **Memory:** 8 KB Main RAM, 16 KB Video RAM.
*   **Graphics:** Custom Video Display Processor (VDP) based on the Texas Instruments TMS9918. Capable of 64 sprites (though with limitations), tile-based backgrounds, scrolling, and a palette of 64 colors (typically 32 on-screen).
*   **Sound:** Texas Instruments SN76489 PSG (Programmable Sound Generator) chip, providing 3 square wave channels and 1 noise channel. (Later Japanese models included an optional FM sound chip).
*   **Storage:** Game cartridges and credit card-sized "Sega Cards". Some models had built-in games.

## Significance:

While the Master System struggled against the NES market dominance in North America and Japan, it achieved significant success in Europe and Brazil, where it maintained popularity for many years, even after the arrival of 16-bit consoles. Its hardware was technically superior to the NES in some areas (e.g., color palette, CPU speed), though its sound capabilities were generally considered weaker.

It established Sega as a major console manufacturer and laid the groundwork for its successor, the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive.
