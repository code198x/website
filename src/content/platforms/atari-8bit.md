The Atari 8-bit family refers to a line of home computers introduced by Atari, Inc. in 1979 with the Atari 400 and Atari 800 models. This was followed by the streamlined XL series (600XL, 800XL, 1200XL) starting in 1983, and the XE series (65XE, 130XE) and XEGS console in 1985.

These machines were notable for their custom co-processor chips which provided advanced graphics and sound capabilities compared to many contemporaries.

## Key Features (Atari 800):

*   **Processor:** MOS Technology 6502 @ 1.79 MHz (NTSC) / 1.77 MHz (PAL)
*   **Memory:** 48 KB RAM (800), 16 KB RAM (400), expandable. XL/XE models came with 64KB or 128KB.
*   **Graphics:** Handled by custom chips ANTIC (display list processor) and GTIA (graphics television interface adaptor). Supported multiple graphics modes, display list interrupts, smooth scrolling, player/missile graphics (sprites), and a wide color palette (up to 256 colors, though typically fewer simultaneously).
*   **Sound:** Custom POKEY (Pot Keyboard Integrated Circuit) chip provided 4 channels of sound, plus handled keyboard scanning and serial I/O.
*   **Storage:** External cassette recorders or floppy disk drives (like the Atari 810).

## Significance:

The Atari 8-bit computers were technologically advanced for their time, offering capabilities that rivaled or exceeded many competitors. They developed a strong following and a large software library, particularly rich in games. The custom chip architecture, while powerful, also presented a steeper learning curve for programmers compared to simpler systems.

The XL and XE series refined the design and lowered costs, extending the platform's life into the late 1980s.
