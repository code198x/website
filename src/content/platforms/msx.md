MSX was a standardized home computer architecture, announced by Microsoft Japan and ASCII Corporation in 1983. Unlike specific models, MSX was a specification that various electronics manufacturers (like Sony, Panasonic, Philips, Yamaha, Sanyo, Mitsubishi) adhered to, creating their own compatible machines.

The standard evolved over time, with MSX2 (1985), MSX2+ (1988), and MSX Turbo R (1990) offering enhanced capabilities.

## Key Features (MSX Standard):

*   **Processor:** Zilog Z80A @ 3.58 MHz
*   **Memory:** Minimum 8 KB RAM (most had 32KB or 64KB), 32 KB ROM (containing MSX BASIC).
*   **Graphics:** Texas Instruments TMS9918 VDP (Video Display Processor), same as used in the ColecoVision. Capable of 16 colors, tile-based graphics, and hardware sprites.
*   **Sound:** General Instrument AY-3-8910 PSG (Programmable Sound Generator), providing 3 channels plus noise.
*   **Storage:** Typically cassette interface and cartridge slots. Floppy disk drives were common add-ons or integrated into later models.

## Key Features (MSX2 Standard):

*   **Processor:** Zilog Z80A @ 3.58 MHz (or higher compatible)
*   **Memory:** Minimum 64 KB RAM (often 128 KB), 48 KB ROM.
*   **Graphics:** Yamaha V9938 VDP. Significantly enhanced capabilities, including higher resolutions (up to 512Ã—212), more colors (up to 256 from a palette of 512), hardware scrolling, and improved sprites.
*   **Sound:** AY-3-8910 (as per MSX1).

## Significance:

The MSX standard aimed to unify the fragmented home computer market, similar to what the VHS standard did for video recorders. While it didn't achieve dominance in the US or UK, it was very successful in Japan, continental Europe (especially the Netherlands and Spain), Brazil, and some other regions. It hosted many classic games, particularly from Japanese developers like Konami and Hudson Soft.
